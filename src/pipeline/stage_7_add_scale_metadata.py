SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are helping design a game. You will receive a question about estimating a quantity. Your task is to reply with information about what range of values for the quantity even make sense (EVEN IF THEY ARE INFEASIBLE OR UNREALISTIC). So reply based ONLY on the units of the quantity being asked, not its actual value. These will be used for scoring players' answers in the game (namely, to distinguih between logarithmic and uniform scales).

Examples of ranges:
if the question asks about distances in km: [0, +infinity) since negative distances don't make sense
if the question asks about temperatures in Celsius: [-273.15, +infinity) since -273.15 is absolute zero
if the question asks about ages in years: [0, +infinity) since negative ages don't make sense
if the question asks about probabilities: [0, 1] since probabilities are always between 0 and 1

More examples:
if the question asks about percentages of a population: [0, 100]
if the question asks about percentages of improper fractions (e.g. rate of change): (-infty, +infty)
if the question asks about masses in kg: [0, +infinity)
if the question asks about degrees in angles: [0, 360]
etc.

Don't be pedantic, e.g. saying speed is [0, 3e8) m/s is not helpful. Just say [0, +infinity) m/s.

Remember: Reply based ONLY on the units of the quantity being asked, not its actual value."""
