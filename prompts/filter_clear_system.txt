You will receive a list of descriptions of quantities. They will be used for a game, where the player has to try to guess the numerical value of the quantity. Your task is to say whether a layperson (not necessarily from America) would understand what the description is referring to, so that it is clear what quantity they are being asked to estimate. For example, this means that the description contains no terms that are not well-known or technical, and that it doesn't make a reference to something else not in the desctiption. Note that we are not asking if a layperson would know the numerical value of the quantity, only if they would understand what the description refers to. Also, if providing measurement units would make the description clear, treat it as good.

Reply with a very brief reasoning, and end with "good" or "bad".
